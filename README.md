<h1>Using Neopixel strips for my windows</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>The idea here is to use NeoPixel strips to be able to provide holiday color to my front windows. To that end, I hacked up a PCB, bought a lot of NeoPixel strips, and glued in a connected Photon to help me keep track of time. This is what I'm using for the code.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Start with a Photon from Particle.io, add in a PCB to help distribute power and signal, and put the lights into
your windows.</p>
<p>Download the code here and create a new project using Atom. You only need to build the WindowLights.ino, but all the other .cpp and .h files need to be local. Once it's built, you can upload it. From there, it should just work as advertised. When Christmas rolls around, you'll see Christmas lights. When Halloween rolls around, you'll see Halloween lights. And so on.</p>
<h2>What do you need to do this?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Photon from particle.io</li>
<li>Order the PCB from a good fab. I like OSH Park for this, low cost, reliable.</li>
<li>Neopixel strips attached to your window somehow</li>
</ul>
