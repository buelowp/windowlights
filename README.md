# Window Light using a Teensy and NeoPixels
The goal is to use a variety of smart low cost/power HW
to drive a large set of decorative window lights in
an intelligent way. This code has the goal of being able
to do the following.

1. Recognize the time of day
2. Calculate the position of the sun
3. Figure out what time period we should run specific light
programs in
4. Provide a means to turn them on and off magically.

This includes the following HW
Adafruit GPS module
Teensy 3.1
Neopixel strips
ExpressPCB created PCB's to make this easier to put together

More details to come on the WiKi when I get some time.
